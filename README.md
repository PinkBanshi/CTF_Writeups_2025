# CTF_Writeups_2025

## Setting up my enivornment

I have an old computer that I use only for CTF's and practice. Instead of using a virtual machine of Kali, I installed Kali as my main operating system on that computer. I will follow instructions from [Kali's Hard Disk installation docs](https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/hard-disk-install/)

1. Since I am starting from a Windows device, and chosing to boot from a USB drive, I am following [Kali's live USB install docs](https://www.kali.org/docs/usb/live-usb-install-with-windows/)
  - Download a [live image](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-live) to boot from a USB stick
  - Download Etcher from [their website](https://etcher.balena.io/)
  - Format the USB drive to `fat32`
  - Use Etcher to flash the live image to the USB drive
