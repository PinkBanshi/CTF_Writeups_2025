# TJ CTF

June 6th - June 8th.

Hosted by the [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://ctf.tjctf.org/), I originally was not going to compete in this CTF because I was camping without reception for most of it, but thought this was going to be a nice easy CTF and wanted to check it out.

I competed alone and got 461st of 723 teams who scored at least a point.

Given the site will tell you if your guess is too high or too low, we know that we can halve the number of possibilities by guessing the mid point. For example, the range is 1-1000, our first guess is 500. Being told that this was
